# Browser-based notepad
Hey there! This is just a simple browser-based notepad I made very quickly while at work so I didn't have to open more applications. Tiniest footprint and no frills or whistles. Pure text-typing beauty!

### How does it work?
Currently, it's literally just a full viewport textarea written in HTML. No features other than a placeholder text that shows the version number.

### License
I've put this out under the MIT license!
